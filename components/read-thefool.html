          A word-press based website on spirituality, personal development and
          information sharing. The request was to create a convenient,
          self-reflecting and out of type website where she can share her
          knowledge and also adress her clients.
        </p>
        <p>
          So I used these and that tools in order to obtain a clean and proper
          working website. I worked on the design language with the client to
          emphasize her mystical and <i>art-lover</i> nature better. As a
          result we had an extraordinary, entertaining and user-friendly
          website.

          This beautiful website is created with the help of probably the most
